          These cards are dedicated to you . . .<br />
          If you do not evade the challenge of personal growth.
          <br />
          If you recognize that you have unused potential or not fully developed
          ones.
          <br />
          If you accept that life is not stagnation, but a never ending learning
          process.
          <br />
          If you acknowledge that, to advance in life, you must have a desire to
          be greater than you are.
          <br />
          If you are convinced that you are unique and that every uniqueness has
          its own greatness.
          <br />
          If you believe that nothing is impossible for a willing mind and that
          to lose the winning spirit is to lose all.
          <br />
          If you are ready to take each day as it comes and then make in into
          the kind of day that you want it to be.
